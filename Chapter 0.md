# Intro 

In the summer of 2016 I was elected as a backup delegate for the Republican party representing my neighborhood. Humorously, I had not attended the meeting nor had I campaigned for the position, but somebody thought I'd do a good job and nominated me and I won. My neighor Julia was kind enough to call me from the meeting to confirm I was ok with the nomination. With my newfound responsibility I set about the task of attempting to understand the needs, beliefs, and desires of the people in my neighborhood so as to effectively represent them in our caucus. 

I took the work seriously and wanted to take a robust approach for this task. As of then I had eight years of experience as a strategy consultant and was very well-trained in assessing leaders, organizations, initiatives, and all other aspects of organizations in very structured, researched, and methodical ways. I have amassed gigabytes of literature and frameworks on how to assess every corner of a company; surely similar work had been done on voting.  

To find these assessment frameworks, I reached out to a political science professor at a large, renowned university for help. I will never forget our phone call; I explained my duty and approach to the man, and asked if he could share some thoughts and point me to writings and research on how to pick a candidate. His response didn't shock me at first, he said "mostly, people just vote for whoever's ideas they agree with." "Of course," I replied, but I wanted to do better than that. Surely someone had put something comprehensive together on how to assess individual candidates for fitness for office? "I've never heard anything like that" he replied. In fact, the thought had never occurred to him. 

This was not an isolated incident. I had a similar conversation with another professor. This professor was dismissive of the idea altogether, as though it were naïve to try to put rigor into the analysis of a candidate for fitness of office. I was stunned. 

I Googled for research, but found nothing of value. Did nobody know how to think through a candidate's fitness? Of course this basic idea has crossed many people's minds, but had anyone created anything beyond superficial and released it? I didn't find it. Over the intervening years I periodically checked. During the '20 presidential cycle I looked hard again, but found nothing that went beneath the surface. 

I never found what I'm looking for, so I'm building it. 

# Outline 

Elected officials' decisions impact everything, and there are a lot of these people. Major decisions such as how much we pay in taxes to all levels of government, what our schools teach our children, what nations and organizations are allies or terrorists, and where our military engages are a few examples. Local and smaller scale decisions affect our every day lives as well. Yet when we vote, most people don't have the knowledge to say "my city council candidate has a background in construction and a lot of connections in that industry, as well as a successful history of delivering public works projects, but also has a string of failed partnerships and a bad temper" unless that candidate tells you; and candidates tend to say what they think is most effective to get them voted, which leaves little room for more than a slogan on a sign as you drive by.   

Candidates are, ultimately, marketing and selling their qualification for office. This is the way of the world. In the world of investments every investment firm sells you on their performance – and they can make mediocrity look brilliant! Vendors sell their wares and companies even sell themselves – literally in a merger or acquisition. On the individual level, car dealerships sell cars; companies great and shabby recruit people, and a million other people are selling something around you. With all of these, the responsibility for due dilligence is always on you the buyer, every time.  

I've done extensive work in due dilligence in investments, corporate acquisition, and vendor purchases. I spent years as a strategist assessing companies and markets, and as an executive negotiating deals. I have many formally documented methodologies for conducting "due dilly" for each and at the foundations of them the principles are all the same. In fact have seen material on how to evaluate all kind of things, yet I've never seen a candidate due dilligence methodology. What follows is just that, and instructions on how to fill it out. Like all due dilligence, you'll get better with practice; but even following a simple framework will go miles to keeping you from making some very basic mistakes. 

For those with such background, I thought about framing this as either an assessment akin to a strategy / organization assessment or a due dilligence assessment. Generally speaking, in a classic assessment you’re looking at an organization fundamentally with an eye towards how you would run the thing and make it better. With due diligence, you’re looking with an eye towards whether or not the thing is going to deliver for you when you want. Given our elected officials fall under the latter, I've taken that approach.
