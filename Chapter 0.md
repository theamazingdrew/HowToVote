# Intro 

In the summer of 2016 I was elected as a backup delegate for the Republican party representing my neighborhood. Humorously, I had not attended the meeting nor had I campaigned for the position, but somebody thought I'd do a good job and nominated me and I won. My neighor Julia was kind enough to call me from the meeting to confirm I was ok with the nomination. With my newfound responsibility I set about the task of attempting to understand the needs, beliefs, and desires of the people in my neighborhood so as to effectively represent them in our caucus. 

I took the work seriously and wanted to take a robust approach for this task. As of then I had eight years of experience as a strategy consultant and was very well-trained in assessing leaders, organizations, initiatives, and all other aspects of organizations in very structured, researched, and methodical ways. I have amassed gigabytes of literature and frameworks on how to assess every corner of a company; surely similar work had been done on voting.  

To find these assessment frameworks, I reached out to a political science professor at a large, renowned university for help. I will never forget our phone call; I explained my duty and approach to the man, and asked if he could share some thoughts and point me to writings and research on how to pick a candidate. His response didn't shock me at first, he said "mostly, people just vote for whoever's ideas they agree with." "Of course," I replied, but I wanted to do better than that. Surely someone had put something comprehensive together on how to assess individual candidates for fitness for office? "I've never heard anything like that" he replied. In fact, the thought had never occurred to him. 

This was not an isolated incident. I had a similar conversation with another professor. This professor was dismissive of the idea altogether, as though it were naïve to try to put rigor into the analysis of a candidate for fitness of office. I was stunned. 

I Googled for research, but found nothing of value. Did nobody know how to think through a candidate's fitness? Of course this basic idea has crossed many people's minds, but had anyone created anything beyond superficial and released it? I didn't find it. Over the intervening years I periodically checked. During the '20 presidential cycle I looked hard again, but found nothing that went beneath the surface. 

I never found what I'm looking for, so I'm building it. 

# Why?

Elected officials' decisions impact everything, and there are a lot of these people. Major decisions such as how much we pay in taxes to all levels of government, what our schools teach our children, what nations and organizations are allies or terrorists, and where our military engages are a few examples. Local and smaller scale decisions affect our every day lives as well. Yet when we vote, most people don't have the knowledge to say "my city council candidate has a background in construction and a lot of connections in that industry, as well as a successful history of delivering public works projects, but also has a string of failed partnerships and a bad temper" unless that candidate tells you; and candidates tend to say what they think is most effective to get them voted, which leaves little room for more than a slogan on a sign as you drive by. 

Candidates are, ultimately, marketing and selling their qualification for office. This is the way of the world. In the world of investments every investment firm sells you on their performance – and they can make mediocrity look brilliant! Vendors sell their wares and companies even sell themselves – literally in a merger or acquisition. On the individual level, car dealerships sell cars; companies great and shabby recruit people, and a million other people are selling something around you. With all of these, the responsibility for due dilligence is always on you the buyer, every time.  

The best insights often come from collecting ideas from disparate communities. I've done extensive work in due dilligence in investments, corporate acquisition, and vendor purchases. I spent years as a strategist assessing companies and markets, and as an executive negotiating deals. For all of this, I have many formally documented methodologies for conducting "due dilly" for each and at the foundations of them the principles are all the same. In fact have seen material on how to evaluate all kind of things, yet I've never seen a candidate due dilligence methodology. What follows is the outcome of translating many lessons from assessing just about anything and combining those with insights and understanding of political systems, with instructions on how to fill it out. Like all due dilligence, you'll get better with practice; but even following a simple framework will go miles to keeping you from making some very basic mistakes. 

For those familiar with my background, I thought about framing this as either an assessment akin to a strategy / organization assessment or a due dilligence assessment. Generally speaking, in a classic assessment you’re looking at an organization fundamentally with an eye towards how you would run the thing and make it better. With due diligence, you’re looking with an eye towards whether or not the thing is going to deliver for you when you want. Given our elected officials fall under the latter, I've taken that approach. 

# How It Works

The better you are at the following, the better of a voter you will be:
1. Understanding how your government, and governing in general, actually works
2. Creating an informed opinion on what priorities matter and how to solve them
3. Assessing candidates for office and voting for them

This book is about bullet three, but I want to speak briefly to the first two. For the first item, may resources exist and exploring this field is outside the scope of this book. For starters, read the constitution, the declaration of independence, and bill of rights. Find good synopses of them. Familiarize youreself with your state constitution. I won't lie here, you can make an entire career out of understanding all this and many people do. If you dedicate a few evenings to reading you can be reasonably well-enough informed to have a useful grasp on governing. // Add some recommended resources

Bullet two is an interesting one, both because of the nature of creating these opinions and because I haven't seen a great attempt at this either. Who is out there compiling our major issues, substantiating their value, and arguing for prioritization and allocating resources to them? Lots of opinions exist, but I don't see enough of real substance. This bothers me as much as the lack of a voting framework, and I may yet make a project out of addressing bullet two. For now, be forewarned that every politically charged issue is both comprehensively and poorly documented. Analysis, done well, sees issues from the perspectives of all sides and describes them them the way each proponent or opponent group would in their own words. More often you'll find one party arguing their position in the best light they can, frequently disregarding criticisms of their position, and too often misrepresenting the positions of those with whom they disagree. For most people, their sources of insight consist of news (extremely biased and oversimplified), social media (a mishmash of extreme bias, oversimplification, and thousands and thousands of troll accounts from Russia, China, and others). Slogans are easy and memes memorable, but you need better. For now, use your best judgment. // Come back to this section. There has to be a better answer to give, even in short form.
