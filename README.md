How To Vote - An open source book on how to vote in elections

This effort is the result of a series of experiences I've had over the last several years in which I realized - almost nobody knows how to vote (intelligently) in an ellection. 

# How It Started

I vividly remember a conversation I had in the summer of 2016; I had recently been elected as a backup delegate for the Republican party representing my neighborhood. I had not attended the meeting nor had I campaigned for the position, but somebody thought I'd do a good job and nominated me and I won. With this newfound responsibility, I set about the task of attempting to understand the needs, beliefs, and desires of the people in my neighborhood so as to effectively represent them in our caucus. 
 
I'm a classic centrist; my voting record at that point aligned largely to my beliefs and sense of whether or not the candidate would be effective, but I wanted a more robust approach for this job. At this point I had eight years of experience as a strategy consultant and was very well-trained in assessing leaders, organizations, initiatives, etc. in a very structured, resesarched, and methodical way. I have ammassed gigabytes of literature and frameworks on how to assess every corner of a company; surely similar work has been done on voting. So I started with this approach to researching the candidates.

I reached out to a political science professor at a large, prestigious university nearby to discuss applied political science, specifically with regards to selecting a candidate. I will never forget our phone call; I explained my duty and approach to the man, and asked him if he could share some thoughts and point me to writings and research on how to pick a candidate. His response didn't shock me at first, he said "mostly, people just vote for whoever's ideas they agree with." "Of course," I replied, but I wanted to do better than that. Surely someone had put something comprehensive together on how to assess individual candidates for fitness for office? "I've never heard anything like that" he replied. I realized the thought had never occurred to him. 

This was not an isolated incident. I had a similar conversations with another professor. This time the professor was dismissive of the idea, as though it were na√Øve to try to put rigor into the analysis of a candidate for fitness of office. I was stunned. 

So I turned to everyone's fallback at the time when experts fail: Google. I found nothing of value. Did nobody know how to think through a candidate's fitness? Did it even occur to anybody to try? Of course this basic idea has, but has anyone done it and released it?

Over the intervening years I periodically checked. During the '20 presidential cycle I looked, but the closest I found was a website that helps you pick based on how you feel about the day's hot-button issues. This didn't help people think through anything, in fact it only told how what you currently think aligns to the stated opinions of candidates. Things that answer questions like "does the candidate build coalitions," "what is the candidates history of execution," "what experience does the candidate have in effective leadership" don't exist in these sorts of sites. 

I never found what I'm looking for, so in the American tradition I'm building something. This is a politically agnostic framework for assessing each of our candidates and their fitness for office, with some rubric and justification for why.
