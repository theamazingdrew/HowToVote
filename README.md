# How It Started
I vividly remember a conversation I had in the summer of 2016; I had recently been elected as a backup delegate for the Republican party representing my neighborhood. (I had not attended the meeting nor had I campaigned for the position, but somebody thought I'd do a good job and nominated me and I won.) With this newfound responsibility, I set about the task of attempting to understand the needs, beliefs, and desires of the people in my neighborhood so as to effectively represent them in our caucus. 
 
I'm a classic centrist; my voting record at that point and now aligns to my beliefs and sense of whether or not the candidate would be effective, but I wanted a more robust approach for this task. As of then I had eight years of experience as a strategy consultant and was very well-trained in assessing leaders, organizations, initiatives, etc. in a very structured, resesarched, and methodical way. I have ammassed gigabytes of literature and frameworks on how to assess every corner of a company; surely similar work had been done on voting. So I started with this approach to researching the candidates.

I reached out to a political science professor at a large, renowned university to discuss applied political science for selecting a candidate. I will never forget our phone call; I explained my duty and approach to the man, and asked him if he could share some thoughts and point me to writings and research on how to pick a candidate. His response didn't shock me at first, he said "mostly, people just vote for whoever's ideas they agree with." "Of course," I replied, but I wanted to do better than that. Surely someone had put something comprehensive together on how to assess individual candidates for fitness for office? "I've never heard anything like that" he replied. Shortly I realized the thought had never occurred to him. 

This was not an isolated incident. I had a similar conversations with another professor. This time the professor was dismissive of the idea, as though it were na√Øve to try to put rigor into the analysis of a candidate for fitness of office. I was stunned. 

So I turned to everyone's fallback at the time when experts fail: Google. I found nothing of value. Did nobody know how to think through a candidate's fitness? Of course this basic idea has crossed many people's minds, but has anyone done it and released it?

Over the intervening years I periodically checked. During the '20 presidential cycle I looked hard again, but found nothing that went beneath the surface. 

I never found what I'm looking for, so I'm building it.

# Assumptions
 
Key assumptions are as follows: 
1. Circumstances matter. No one leader is the right person for all situations. She or he may excel in one political position during one time, and may fail in another. Thus, this work needs to comprehend that. For example, the kind of leaders needed in peacetime and growth often differ from the kinds needs in recessions and / or war.
2. Everything is trade-offs. What makes a candidate strong can also be a weakness.
3. No assessment model is perfect. The tradeoff of comprehensiveness and practicality will always exist. Reducing people to a scoresheet is imperfect; writing a 1000 page analysis on each individual will never be read.
4. Objective right and wrong, good and bad, do exist. Understanding what that might be is hard, and applying to to individual circumstances harder, but is a worthy endeavor
5. Substantiate where possible. If your suggestion is an argument for something, back that argument up. Data sources, quotes, (high quality) academic papers, etc. are valued. Example: "Science says X" is bad. "Professors W in Journal of X 2007, article titled Y concluded Z" is good.
