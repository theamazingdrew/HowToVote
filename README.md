# How It Started
In the summer of 2016 I was elected as a backup delegate for the Republican party representing my neighborhood. Humorously, I had not attended the meeting nor had I campaigned for the position, but somebody thought I'd do a good job and nominated me and I won. My neighor Julia was kind enough to call me from the meeting to confirm I was ok with the nomination. With my newfound responsibility I set about the task of attempting to understand the needs, beliefs, and desires of the people in my neighborhood so as to effectively represent them in our caucus. 

I took the work seriously and wanted to take a robust approach for this task. As of then I had eight years of experience as a strategy consultant and was very well-trained in assessing leaders, organizations, initiatives, and all other aspects of organizations in very structured, researched, and methodical ways. I have amassed gigabytes of literature and frameworks on how to assess every corner of a company; surely similar work had been done on voting.  

To find these assessment frameworks, I reached out to a political science professor at a large, renowned university for help. I will never forget our phone call; I explained my duty and approach to the man, and asked if he could share some thoughts and point me to writings and research on how to pick a candidate. His response didn't shock me at first, he said "mostly, people just vote for whoever's ideas they agree with." "Of course," I replied, but I wanted to do better than that. Surely someone had put something comprehensive together on how to assess individual candidates for fitness for office? "I've never heard anything like that" he replied. In fact, the thought had never occurred to him. 

This was not an isolated incident. I had a similar conversation with another professor. This professor was dismissive of the idea altogether, as though it were na√Øve to try to put rigor into the analysis of a candidate for fitness of office. I was stunned. 

I Googled for research, but found nothing of value. Did nobody know how to think through a candidate's fitness? Of course this basic idea has crossed many people's minds, but had anyone created anything beyond superficial and released it? I didn't find it. Over the intervening years I periodically checked. During the '20 presidential cycle I looked hard again, but found nothing that went beneath the surface. 

I never found what I'm looking for, so I'm building it. 

# Assumptions
 
Key assumptions are as follows: 
1. Circumstances matter. No one leader is the right person for all situations. She or he may excel in one political position during one time, and may fail in another. Thus, this work needs to comprehend that. For example, the kind of leaders needed in peacetime and growth often differ from the kinds needs in recessions and / or war.
2. Everything is trade-offs. What makes a candidate strong can also be a weakness.
3. No assessment model is perfect. The tradeoff of comprehensiveness and practicality will always exist. Reducing people to a scoresheet is imperfect; a 1000 page analysis on each individual will never be read.
4. Objective right and wrong, good and bad, do exist. Morality is real. Understanding what that might be is hard, and applying it to individual circumstances often harder, but is a worthy endeavor.
5. Substantiate where possible. If a suggestion is an argument for something, back that argument up. Data sources, quotes, (high quality) academic papers, etc. are valued. Example: "Science says X" is bad. "Professors W in Journal of X 2007, article titled Y concluded Z with the following data and methodology" is good.
